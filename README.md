# HexBuilder

A procedural generator of hexagons grids

Each hexagon on the map is dynamically generated using Perlin noise. The biomes, defined by Voronoi diagrams, contribute coherence and variety to the environment.

Currently the initializing is really messy becouse I change it from an in editor tool to runtime, may change it once I decide what to do next with the project
